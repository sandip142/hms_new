We welcome contributions! Please follow these steps to contribute:

### Setting Up for Development

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature

```

### Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep components small and focused

2. **Component Guidelines**
   - Place new components in appropriate directories
   - Create reusable components in `components/common`
   - Use proper file naming: `PascalCase` for component files

3. **State Management**
   - Use React hooks appropriately
   - Place custom hooks in the `hooks` directory
   - Keep context providers minimal and focused

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Test your changes thoroughly
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Ensure all tests pass:
```bash
npm run test
```

### Submitting Changes
